## Data Science Project: Phone Price Analysis

This project analyzes the Mobiles Dataset (2025) by Abdul Malik on Kaggle, which contains 930 phones with 15 features, including company, model, RAM, camera specs, battery capacity, and launch prices across multiple countries (Pakistan, India, China, the United States, and the UAE).

### Goals for this project:

- Understand how launch prices vary by country and explore trends across markets.

- Analyze how specific phone features relate to price, identifying which specs drive cost the most.

- Build a predictive model to estimate the price of future phones based on their features in each region.

This repo includes our data exploration, visualizations, and final predictive model results.
